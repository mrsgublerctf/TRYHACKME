# My Cybersecurity Journey
TryHackMe is a great place to explore the cybersecurity and coding world.
I have done a lot of cybersecurity and coding courses, but most recently I have been working on TryHackMe. I decided to go back into Linux and explore it in more depth, and I did so by using the Linux course on TryhackMe. I struggle with learning and focusing and the only way I can truly understand a topic is by unique and entertaining ways. TryHackMe has allowed me to understand in ways that other courses have not allowed me to. If you are someone who struggles with learning. I highly recommend using TryHackMe as it has interactive videos and quizzes at the end that will test your knowledge.
